# sass-7.1-boilerplate
Handy way to create a basic Sass/Scss folder and files structure for 7-1 Sass architecture. Tested on mac.

Create this folder structure with empty scss files inside:
abstracts/mixins
abstracts/_variables
abstracts/helpers
base/animations
base/typography
base/utilities
base/base
components/buttons
layout/grid
layout/header
layout/footer
layout/navigation
pages/home
themes/theme
themes/admin
vendors/jquery-ui
At the end create a main scss file with all the ready to activate import commands.
