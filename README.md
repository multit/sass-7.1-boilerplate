# sass-7.1-boilerplate
Handy way to create a basic Sass/Scss folder and files structure for 7-1 Sass architecture. Tested on mac.

Create this folder structure with empty scss files inside:

abstracts/mixins
<br />abstracts/_variables
<br />abstracts/helpers
<br />base/animations
<br />base/typography
<br />base/utilities
<br />base/base
<br />components/buttons
<br />layout/grid
<br />layout/header
<br />layout/footer
<br />layout/navigation
<br />pages/home
<br />themes/theme
<br />themes/admin
<br />vendors/jquery-ui

At the end create a main scss file with all the ready to activate import commands.
